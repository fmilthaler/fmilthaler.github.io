This is an overview of my current projects.


FinQuant
====================
FinQuant is a program for financial portfolio management, analysis and optimisation. It is designed to generate an object that holds your data, e.g. stock prices of different stocks, which automatically computes the most common quantities, such as Expected annual Return, Volatility and Sharpe Ratio. Moreover, it provides a library for computing different kinds of Returns and visualising Moving Averages and Bollinger Bands. Finally, given a set of stocks, it also allows for finding optimised portfolios.

FinQuant is made to be easily extended. I hope it proves itself useful for hobby investors, students, geeks, and the intellectual curious.

Turbine-Geometry-AutoMagic (TGAM)
====================
This project provides the user a Python class which allows the them to specify a number of parameters in order to automagically generate the geometry (and mesh) of a wind/tidal turbine in Cubit.

HPCMonitor
====================
This project provides a Python class aims to automate tasks associated with running jobs on HPC systems, e.g. estimation of required number of cores, data analysis/crunching, text processing, error checking, automatic e-mail reports. It is a very effective and useful tool especially when thousands of simulations are running simultaneously.

Py2PGFPlotsTable
====================
This project aims to automate the process, thus to fill the gap between generating data and writing the corresponding LaTeX commands to create a table. The comprehensive and package PGFPlotsTable is used on the LaTeX front.

moderncvstyles
====================
This LaTeX packages provides a few more styles for the popular LaTeX moderncv package, which are mostly modifications of the styles provided by moderncv.
