This is an overview of my current projects.

Turbine-Geometry-AutoMagic (TGAM)
====================
This project provides the user a Python class which allows the them to specify a number of parameters in order to automagically generate the geometry (and mesh) of a wind/tidal turbine in Cubit.

HPCMonitor
====================
This project provides a Python class aims to automate tasks associated with running jobs on HPC systems, e.g. estimation of required number of cores, data analysis/crunching, text processing, error checking, automatic e-mail reports. It is a very effective and useful tool especially when thousands of simulations are running simultaneously.

Py2PGFPlotsTable
====================
This project aims to automate the process, thus to fill the gap between generating data and writing the corresponding LaTeX commands to create a table. The comprehensive and package PGFPlotsTable is used on the LaTeX front.

moderncvstyles
====================
This LaTeX packages provides a few more styles for the popular LaTeX moderncv package, which are mostly modifications of the styles provided by moderncv.
