It is a very effective and useful tool especially when thousands of simulations are running simultaneously.  \r\n[Link to HPCMonitor](http://github.com/fmilthaler/HPCMonitor)\r\n\r\n## Py2PGFPlotsTable\r\nThis project aims to automate the process, thus to fill the gap between generating data and writing the corresponding LaTeX commands to create a table. The comprehensive and package PGFPlotsTable is used on the LaTeX front.  \r\n[Link to Py2PGFPlotsTable](http://github.com/fmilthaler/py2pgfplotstable)\r\n\r\n## moderncvstyles\r\nThis LaTeX packages provides a few more styles for the popular LaTeX moderncv package, which are mostly modifications of the styles provided by moderncv.  \r\n[Link to moderncv on ctan](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/moderncv)  \r\n[Link to moderncvstyles on github](http://github.com/fmilthaler/moderncvstyles)\r\n\r\n## GitHub overview\r\nThis [overview](http://github.com/fmilthaler) shows you what projects I'm currently working on GitHub.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
